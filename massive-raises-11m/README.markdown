The dominant internet business models, ads and paywalls, don’t work for the vast majority of people
around the world, whether they’re users or developers. We think we’ve found a better way, one that
doesn’t distract users or compromise their privacy and is accessible to almost everyone. We’re
excited to announce that we just raised an $11 million seed round for our startup,
[Massive](https://joinmassive.com/), to spread this new business model.

Here’s more info about what we’re working on and how you can get involved.

_[Our newsletter](https://upscri.be/f/c3cwu9) covers more about distributed computing and
re-decentralizing the internet._

## What we do

Massive provides an SDK to app developers that lets users opt in to pay for premium features with
their devices’ idle computing resources. We pool these resources together, like a bunch of mini data
centers, and compensate the developers by hosting blockchain infrastructure, mining cryptocurrency
and, in the future, performing general distributed tasks. We don’t collect or store any personal
info and we actively collaborate with compliance partners to ensure our SDK is always safe for
developers to include in their apps.

Hundreds of thousands of users have paid with Massive while we were quietly building. Conversion
rates for our developer partners, who give their users the option to pay with Massive, are
consistently 30% or higher and their average revenue per user (ARPU) is over 3x higher than their
ARPU with ads.

## Who invested

We wanted our lead investor to be a fintech fund with both cryptocurrency and non-cryptocurrency
investments so they’d support both Massive as payments infrastructure company and our future plans
to collaborate more closely with blockchain projects. We’re excited that
[Adam Carson](https://p72.vc/team/adam-k-carson/) from [Point72 Ventures](https://p72.vc/), who
shares this vision for our compute-based business model, has joined our board.

We also wanted to add a syndicate of strategic investors to bring more blockchain experience to our
team, so we couldn’t be happier to welcome [Coinbase Ventures](https://ventures.coinbase.com/),
[Kraken Ventures](https://www.krakenventures.com/),
[BlockTower Capital](https://www.blocktower.com/),
[CoinShares Ventures](https://coinshares.com/active/cs-ventures), and
[Xoogler Ventures](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/supporting-ex-google-founders-launching-xoogler-ventures-fong/),
as well as prominent angel investors [Ryan Selkis](https://messari.io/person/ryan-selkis),
[Prabhakar Reddy](https://blog.falconx.io/falconx-raises-17m-in-financing-to-build-the-future-of-digital-asset-trading/),
[Sriram Krishnan](https://sriramkrishnan.substack.com/), and
[Packy McCormick](https://www.notboring.co/).

## How users of Massive-enabled apps will benefit

We’ll continue putting users first and ensuring that paying with Massive doesn’t affect the normal,
everyday performance of an individual’s device. Part of our secret sauce is that we automatically
throttle the Massive SDK’s usage — as a user needs more of their resources, we use less and vice
versa.

We already have dozens of integrations in progress and launched, through which users get premium
digital apps and services (almost) free. This round will help us integrate with even more partners
so users can access more of the services they love.

## How app developers will benefit

We’ll continue R&D to increase monthly revenue for developers while reducing any potential impact on
end-users’ devices, we’ll strengthen relationships with antivirus vendors, and we’ll extend platform
compatibility beyond desktop.

We’ll also extend the tools and services offered in
[our developer portal](https://partners.joinmassive.com/), adding more metrics, more payment
options, and more configurability around how our SDK is allowed to monetize users’ devices.

## How compute partners, including blockchains, will benefit

We believe decentralization is key to a future where people have autonomy, rather than a handful of
governments and megacorporations, and we’re committed to helping accelerate that future by
providing blockchain and web3 projects with distributed infrastructure. Let us know if you’re
interested in [using our network to distribute or decentralize](https://joinmassive.com/daas) your
project.

## And we’re hiring!

We need help bringing this new business model to hundreds of millions of users, so we’re doubling
our headcount from 10 to 20. We’re currently looking for Business Directors, C/C++ Developers, a
Product Owner, a Blockchain Product Manager, a Director of Security and Compliance, a Business
Operations Associate, an Accountant/Controller, a Blockchain Research Intern, and a Social Media
Intern.

Our open positions are listed at [jobs.joinmassive.com](https://jobs.joinmassive.com/). If you or
anyone else you know fits one of the descriptions on our site and wants to join a fast-growing
startup, please reach out to jobs@joinmassive.com.

We’ll even turn you into a gaming avatar of your design on
[our team page](https://joinmassive.com/team). Here’s mine:
